 This is a class project on Aero 473. We are tasked by our Professor to develop a simple GUI software to enable users estimate the cost, dimensions and other useful parameters for their aircraft design depending on their preferences. The formulae and data used are based on the textbook "Aircraft Conceptual Design" by Raymer.
